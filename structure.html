<h1>Structuring Tests</h1>
<p>
  One of the big reasons to use tuneup is to give some structure to your
  UIAutomation tests. Out of the box, UIAutomation doesn’t provide a real
  first-class way of grouping test code together, so tuneup provides the
  <code>test</code> function.
</p>

<a name="test"></a>
<h2>The 'test' Function</h2>
<p>
  The <code>test</code> function takes two arguments: a short description of your
  test and a JavaScript function that accepts two parameters. The description is
  used by UIAutomation to provide feedback about which test executed. Tuneup passes
  this string along in such a way that the output from Instruments will be grouped
  by this string within the trace document generated by Instruments.
</p>

<p>
  The function takes two parameters, typically named <code>app</code> and
  <code>target</code>. The first is a reference to the <code>UIAApplication</code>
  instance variable for your application, the second is a reference to the
  <code>UIATarget</code> pointing to the current target. These are provided to
  avoid extraneous the boilerplate code required by every UIAutomation test.
</p>

<h2>Test Function Bodies</h2>
<p>
  UIAutomation tests typically alternate between exercising the UI in some
  fashion, then making assertions about its current presentation and state.
  You exercise the UI using UIAutomation’s built-in API, you validate the UI
  using tuneup’s <a href="assertions.html">library of assertions</a>.
</p>

<h2>Grouping Tests</h2>
<p>
  You can declare as many tests in a single file as you see fit. However, for
  maintenance and readability reasons, you should consider grouping tests into
  a single file that all relate to the same feature of the application. For example,
  you may have a login screen to your application that needs to be tested when a
  user successfully logs in, unsuccessfully logs in and when the backend server is
  unavailable. You could structure each of these cases in separate test declarations
  all within a single file.
