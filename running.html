<p>
  There are three primary ways to run UIAutomation tests using tuneup.
</p>

<h2>Using Bwoken (recommended!)</h2>
<p>
  <a href="https://github.com/bendyworks/bwoken">Bwoken</a> is a robust command-line
  executable for running UIAutomation tests. It has nearly all of the benefits of
  tuneup’s built-in test runner plus:
  <ul>
    <li>built-in support for <a href="http://www.coffeescript.org">CoffeeScript</a></li>
    <li>automatic device-detection</li>
    <li>integration with <a href="http://rake.rubyforge.org">Rake</a></li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  Install Bwoken using <a href="http://gembundler.org">Bundler</a>. Once you have it
  installed, adjust your <code>#import</code> statement according to how you installed
  tuneup. If you’re using CocoaPods, your import path should be
  <code>#import "../../../../Pods/tuneup_js/tunup.js"</code>.
</p>

<h2>Using The Built-in Test Runner (deprecated)</h2>
<p>
  Tuneup JS comes with its own test-runner script. It hides a lot of the ugly complexity
  of the <code>instruments</code> command-line executable. It also provides for better
  formatting of output. For details on running tests with this tool, execute
  <code>test_runner/run -h</code> in a terminal window for a detailed explanation of
  the command-line usage and options.
</p>
<p>
  Note that, while the built-in test runner works and has had a lot of great contributions
  made, further support of it has been deprecated because Bwoken provides a much more
  robust feature-set.
</p>
<p>
  Starting in iOS 5, Apple provided a way to run Instruments from the
  command-line. However, it's a bit fiddly and is very general-purpose
  so doing anything <em>useful</em> with the output is kind of a pain.
</p>

<p>
  Tuneup provides a Ruby script (<code>test_runner/run</code>) to run your test scripts.
  The runner will parse the output of your test and produce a proper
  UNIX exit code based on whether or not your tests succeeded. It also
  provides some niceties like automatically specifying the full-path
  to your test script if you don't provide one.
</p>

<p>
  Have a look at <code>test_runner/run --help</code> to be sure you're not missing any newly
  added features like fancy colors.
</p>

<p>To use the runner, invoke it like so:</p>

<pre><code>[path to tuneup]/test_runner/run &lt;app bundle&gt; &lt;test script&gt; &lt;output directory&gt; [optional args]
</code></pre>

<p>
  Normally the name of the app bundle will suffice for the <code>&lt;app bundle&gt;</code>
  argument. If you're running your tests on the simulator the newest bundle
  will be located automatically. If that fails, or if you want to manually
  specify the bundle to be used, you need to provide a <em>fully-qualified</em>
  path to the app bundle, which will be buried somewhere in
  <code>~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData</code>.
</p>

<p>
  The <code>&lt;test script&gt;</code> argument specifies the JavaScript test file and the
  <code>&lt;output directory&gt;</code> is where the resulting Instruments output like screenshots
  and reports should go.
</p>

<p>
  Run the script with <code>-h</code> or <code>--help</code> for a full explanation
  of supported options.
</p>

<h3>Device or Simulator</h3>

<p>
  If you provide the optional argument <code>-d DEVICE</code>, you can tell Instruments
  to run your test against a real device (identified by UDID). You can also
  pass <code>dynamic</code> and tuneup will find the UDID at runtime. If this argument is
  not provided, the runner will run against the simulator.
</p>

<h3>Preprocessing</h3>
<p>
  The Instruments preprocessor causes a lot of headache due to its inability
  to handle <code>#import</code> statements properly. If you pass <code>-p</code>,
  the script will create a temp file, resolve any imports and inline the referenced
  files (only once).
</p>

<h3>Selecting Tests</h3>
<p>
  If you don't want to run your whole test suite, you can selectively run
  tests by specifying the argument <code>-r TEST</code>. Whatever you pass for
  <code>TEST</code> will be used as regex to match any <code>title</code> of your tests.
</p>

<h3>XML reports</h3>
<p>
  Tuneup can generate Xunit style reports that can be analyzed by
  any compatible tool, like Jenkins. Given the parameter <code>-x</code> a XML report
  will be generated in the output directory.
</p>

<h2>Using Instruments</h2>
<p>
  There’s nothing special required to run tuneup within Instruments aside from getting
  the path correct in your initial <code>#import</code> statement.
</p>
