<p>
  There are two ways you can setup tuneupjs in your project: you can install it
  manually, or you can use <a href="http://www.cocoapods.org">CocoaPods</a>.
</p>

<h2><a name="cocoapods">CocoaPods</a></h2>
<p>
  Setting up tuneup using CocoaPods is the preferred way to install tuneup.
</p>

<h3>Step 1</h3>
<p>
  In your
  <code>Podfile</code> add a line for "tuneup_js" like this:
{% highlight ruby %}
platform :ios
pod 'tuneup_js'
# other pods go here
{% endhighlight %}
</p>

<h3>Step 2</h3>
<p>
  Update your installed pods by running <code>pod install</code>. This will create a sub-folder named <code>tuneup_js</code> in your <code>Pods</code> directory.
</p>

<p>
  Now youâ€™re ready to <a href="writing.html">write</a> and <a href="running.html">run</a> some tests.
</p>

<h2><a name="manual">Manual Installation</a></h2>
<p>
  Create a subdirectory in your current project and either manually copy the
  <code>tuneup_js</code> files there, or add <code>tuneup_js</code> as a git submodule.
</p>
